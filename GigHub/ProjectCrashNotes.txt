--Everything in Visual Studio has worked flawlessly since it was first installed.
--Everything in GigHub project has also worked since its beginning
--Everything was still working the morning of 3/4/19
--Then in the afternoon of 3/4/19 all of a suddent I received a not authorized error for Azure DevOps.  It was also not listed under my Microsoft profile in Manage Connections

--In addition, any change I made to ViewModels/GigsViewModel.cs would not get included in the build, while changes to Views/Shared/Gigs.cshtml would.
--I was trying to add a "SearchTerm" string property to GigsViewModel, but I kept getting an error along the lines that my source file has changed from the latest module.
--Then under Controllers/GigsController.cs in the instantiation of a new GigsViewModel I tried to set "SearchTerm" to a specific string value and I set a breakpoint there.  When I ran the project Visual Studio literally highlighted the entire GigsViewModel object in dark red but excluding "SearchTerm".
--On the front-end in Chrome references to "SearchTerm" returned an error saying there was no path to "SearchTerm" defined.
--In other words, changes to the front-end view was run, but changes to the backend model was not compiled.

--I proceeded to do a system restore in Windows 10 to a restore point on 3/1/19 generated by a system update.
--When I ran the project afterwards my AutoMapper was understandably uninstalled and the compiler was complaining about any references to AutoMapper.
--I proceeded to reinstall AutoMapper but the same compiler errors persisted.
--I tried upgrading and downgrading to version 8.0 and back down to 4.1.1, but nothing helped.
--I then tried to undo the system restore.  The same errors still persisted
--At one point I noticed that the packages.config file was filled with zero's
--I restored the old packages.config from from my GitHub backup but to no avail

--On 3/5/19 ~5pm I took the latest (working) copy of my GitHub project backup and completely overrode my project, and that seemed to fix the errors and the project ran successfully.
